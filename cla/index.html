    <h1>Contributor License Agreements</h1>

    <p>
        Like many open source organizations, Relaycorp requires contributors to sign a Contributor License Agreement
        (CLA) in order to protect the Relaynet project and related software from disputes and license violations.
    </p>

    <p>
        CLAs are managed by <a href="https://cla-assistant.io/">CLA Assistant</a>, and you will be prompted to sign the
        CLA when you submit your first Pull Request to the project.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you implemented the Pull Request on behalf of an organization, you should sign the <em>Relaycorp Entity
        Contributor Assignment Agreement</em>. If you are an individual contributor, please sign the <em>Relaycorp
        Individual Contributor Assignment Agreement</em>.
