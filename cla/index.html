<h1>Contributor License Agreements</h1>

<p>
    Relaycorp welcomes contributions from third parties, but to protect the company and the Relaynet project from
    disputes and license violations, we require each contributor to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA).
</p>

<p>
    We use CLAs from the <a href="http://harmonyagreements.org/">Harmony Agreements</a> project and rely on
    <a href="https://cla-assistant.io/">CLA Assistant</a> to enforce them in Pull Requests (PRs).
</p>

<p>
    The process to sign an agreement will depend on whether the contributor is an individual or an organization.
</p>

<h2 id="individual">Individual Contributors</h2>

<p>
    CLA Assistant will prompt individual contributors to sign the CLA when they create their first PR in our GitHub
    organizations.
</p>

<p>
    An <a>entity CLA</a> will be required if the individual contributes on behalf of an organization.
</p>

<h2 id="organization">Entity Contributors</h2>

<p>
    Contributions made on behalf of an organization require the <a href="./entity-cla.pdf"><em>Relaycorp Entity
    Contributor License Agreement</em></a> to be signed by an authorized employee and emailed to
    <a href="mailto:cla@relaycorp.tech?subject=Contributor%20License%20Agreement">cla@relaycorp.tech</a>. The email
    must mention the term "Contributor License Agreement", otherwise it will be automatically deleted by spam filters.
</p>

<p>
    Contributors are encouraged create PRs from forks in their GitHub organizations, so that CLA Assistant can
    automatically approve those PRs. PRs can still be created from personal forks but the user will have to agree to
    the Entity Contributor License Agreement on CLA Assistant when prompted to do so (assuming they are authorized to
    do that); they must also tell us when they leave that organization and wish to continue contributing the project.
