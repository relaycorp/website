# About Relaycorp

We build technologies to solve some of the most pressing communication challenges that humankind faces,
starting with Internet blackouts.
Namely:

- [Awala](https://awala.network), a new computer network where apps can communicate with and without the Internet. It also offers end-to-end encryption and spam protection.
- [Letro](https://letro.app/en/), an Awala-powered email alternative, so it works with and without the Internet, supports end-to-end encryption, and is spam-resistant.
- [VeraId](https://veraid.net), an offline authentication protocol that allows data to be securely attributed to domain names (e.g. `example.com`) and users (e.g. `alice@example.com`). VeraId powers Letro.
- [Despacito](https://despacito.bot), a rate limiting protocol that mitigates DDoS attacks. It's based on the work we did for [the DDoS Report](https://ddos.report/).
